Once your group is created, you can add/invite members, create meetings, manage members and guests and so forth. Create a Group To create a group, after logging in, go to the menus on top right and click on the Create a Group menu. The wizard will walk you through the process and you can add various details about your group including name, description, when and where you meet. Once the group is created, you will be taken to the group's dashboard page. Below is what the dashboard screen looks like when a new group is created: Click on the \"Create new group\" button and enter a name for your group. After that, your group will be created and you will be automatically redirected to your group dashboard page. Settings Reporting Type Within group only : allow referrals and 1-to-1s only between group members to be reported Within organization only : allow referrals and 1-to-1s between members from different groups - but under same organization - to be reported Guest Count Count by entry : when reporting guest count for members, count by number of guests entered into the system. Count by attendance : when reporting guest count for members, count by guest attendance. With this option, a same guest can attend multiple meetings to a same grouop and the person who invited the guest each time will each receive a credit. Custom Fields Custom fields allow additional data to be collected from members when they report referrals or 1-to-1s. For example, you can add a dropdown list caleld \"Referral Source\" with values such as partner referral, customer referral, standard referral, online referral to allow your members to indicate the type of referral when reporting. This additional information allows members to share more information and you can use them in the reports to gain additional insights. Automated Meeting Generation Sometimes, you may want to create future meetings ahead in time to better organize and allow members to tag guests to a future meeting. This requires you to manually create meetings one by one which can be repetitive and cumbersome work. The Automated Meeting feature allows you to automatically generate meetings. After providing the meeting details for your group, simple set a value for the Automatically generate future meetings field. This field will be 0 by default, meaning you will be creating meeting entries manually. If you provide a value greater than 0, then the system will start automatically generating future meetings for you. For example, let's say you set up your meeting with following details: Meeting frequency: biweekly Starting on: Second week Meeting day: Tuesday Meeting time: 9:30am Automatically generate future meetings: 4 meetings This tells the system to always have 4 future meetings created. At midnight everynight, the system will automatically gnerate meetings to ensure that there are always 4 meetings created in future. So if today is August 24, 2019, the above configuration will generate following meeting entries for you: 9:30am August 28, 2019 (next meeting after August 24th) 9:30am September 11, 2019 9:30am September 25, 2019 9:30am October 9, 2019 You can set this to 8 meetings or 12 meetings. It's totally up to you. And if your group meets regularly and you enable this feature, then you will never have to manually create meetings again. Delete Group If you no longer need to maintain a group, you can delete the group by going to the Delete tab within the Group settings page. Deleting a group will delete all the data except referrals. Referral data is managed by giver and receiver.","title":"Group"},{"location":"group/#group","text":"One of the first things you should do as you get started with ChamberForge is setting up your group.

To get started with ChamberForge, you need to do at least following: Create a group Add members 1. Create a group When you register on ChamberForge and log in for the first time, you may see options to create a group or an organization. Group - create a group if you manage a single group of members or businesses. Organization - create an organization if you are with a staff with chamber of commerce or larger business associations with more than one group. If you create an organization, you can still create groups under your organization. 2. Add members Next step is to add members of your group. Click on Members menu from left side. Click \"Add New\" button and start adding one member at a time. The only required fields are name and email - all other fields are optional. 4.

Click on Meetings on the left menu and add a new meeing. 5. Update attendance For each meeting held, you can use ChamberForge to keep track of attendance of members and guests. To do so, click on the meeting you just created in the above step. The first tab you will see is attendance tab. Click on the \"Update Attendance\" button at the bottom. You will then see a list of members and a checkbox next to their name. Click on each checkbox to note attendance for each member. If you have many members, you can click the topmost checkbox and it will automtically check everyone. 6. Add guests If you have guests who attended a meeting, you can add their information. From the meeting page, click on the second tab that says \"Guests\" and click on \"Add New Guest\" button at the bottom. A window will pop up where you can add guest information. You can add as many guest as you want and close the window when done. 7. Add referrals/leads If members reported out any leads or referrals they gave to others, that information can be captured in ChamberForge. From the meeting details screen, click on the third tab called \"Referrals.\" Click on the \"Add New\" button at the bottom and you can enter details about the lead. 8.

The reports help group organizers and association staff members to quickly see how their group is doing. You can generate reports to quickly find out: Who's actively contributing to the group? How are members doing with 1-to-1 meetings over period of time? Are referrals being passed to one another? Are members converting their referrals? Are members meeting their monthly/quarterly goals set forth by group leaders? Where do we need to focus more on as group leader or staff member? Generating Reports To generate reports, click on \"Reports\" on the left menu. Enter the date period and select a type of report. At the time of writing this documentation, two reports are available: Members report and Activity report. Below are reports currently available in ChamberForge. If you have access to the ChamberForge API, you can generate custom reports using tools of your choice such as Google Sheets, Google Data Studio, etc. If you need assistance with custom reports, please contact us at support@chamberforge.com . Members Report The Members report shows all the members in the group and their activities during given period. The activities include guests invited, 1-to-1 meetings had, and leads gave to others in the group. The initial report will give sum of all those three categories for each member, but you can filter out any categories by clicking on the legends. Legends are: Referrals : number of referrals a member gave during the specified period Business Closed : number of business closed during the specified period Guests *: number of guests a member invited. This is driven by the \"Invited by\" field when adding a guest data. 1-to-1s : Number of 1-to-1 meetings a member had during the specified period. Currently, guests are counted based on their entry into the system, not number of meetings they came to. For example, if John invites one guest and the guest came to two meetings, this will still be counted as one guest on the report. in the future than in the past. To avoid confusion, 1-to-1s are based on self-reporting only. For example, if John and Mary had 1-to-1 meeting, and John reports the meeting with Mary but Mary doesn't, Mary will not get a credit for 1-to-1. At the moment, both John and Mary have to report. If you scroll down, you can also see a table as shown below that has the same information in a tabular format. This table also gives you totals for all activities. You can export this data into PDF or Excel where you can do further analysis or share with your group. Referrals Report The Referrals Report shows all referrals generated during the specified time period and their current status. Referral Conversion Report The Referral Conversion Report shows conversion rate for the referrals given by members during specified period. Attendance Report Attendance report shows member attendances during a given period of time. The last column shows aggregate percentage of attendance rate for each member. Legends are: P denotes member was present at the meeting. S denotes substitute attendance. No letter (--) indicates not present at the meeting. Please note that the member's group join date is used when calculating the total attendance percentage. For example, if John joins a group in March, and you are generating the attendance report from January to June, John's absence in January and February will not be counted against him. Therefore, for the attendance report to show correctly, you should set the group join date for all the members in your group. Revenue Earned Report This report shows all the revenues earned by members during specified time period. Average transaction size is calculated by dividing the revenue by referrals. Revenue Referred Report This report is similar to the Revenue Earned Report except this one shows revenues referred by members to other members.","title":"Reporting"},{"location":"reporting/#reporting","text":"In addition to simple reporting available from each group's dashboard screen, ChamberForge allows users to generate more advanced reports.
